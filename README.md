# Remote Music
In it's current state, it is an application designed to remotely control a predefined directory of music files to play on the computer via a mobile app (in this case, running android).

It is made using the Qt framework due to it's ease of portability however factors including installing big libraries on the android device itself made the idea rather impractical and a direct rewrite of the mobile application would run faster and require less dependancies. 

Typical scenario usages:
-Party junction, you want to control the room's music remotely.
-Anywhere where you aren't close enough to your desktop/laptop and would rather it play through anything else than your phone/headphones.
